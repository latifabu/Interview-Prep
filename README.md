-	Was an admin at an accounting firm
-	Volunteer, spoke with people all ages
-	Enjoyed it, positive impact on the community
-	Enjoy exercise and travel

### What is DevOps:
-	DevOps, is a culture, 
-	The aim of devops is to improve development cycle
-	History of devops
-	Conflict between two silos dev and operations
-	Improve collaboration by understanding dev and op needs
-	creating environments that and automated
-	Automated processes and speeds up dev cycle

### Why DevOps:
-	Opportunity to learn different skills
-	Constant learning and growth is necessary to thrive in this field

### Why do you want to become devops engineer?:
-	I like biology
-	Want to make direct impact to community. 
-	Want to learn new skills and develop my knowledge
-	Gives me an opportunity to create projects that can spread health care advice in a matter of seconds
-	
### Benefits of DevOps:
-	Ease of use: config issues found from dev team can be communicated and then resolved. Infrastructure that is described by code can thus be tracked, validated, and reconfigured.
-	Flexible, product owner can easily add multiple features
-	Robust, fast delivery of products for example by using cicd pipeline
-	Cost effective, automation of processes speeds up production by creating CICD pipeline

### Talk about your Journey in sparta global – what skills have you developed
-	Agile methodologies specifically scrum
-	Python (arrays, functions, classes and unit testing)
-	Virtualization on local host
-	Refactored monolith to 2 tier architecture 
-	Covered AWS, created vpc, security groups, auto scaling s3 storage and 
-	Enjoyed seeing how fast AWS is compared to using vagrant to deploy vms

### What is cloud computing
-	Booming
-	Online service
-	Offers severs, storage and databases 
-	Can launch applications in minutes
-	Public, hybrid and private cloud
-	Saves money, don’t need server on prem
-	Pay as you use service
-	Sustainable energy e.g. AWS uses renewable energy to power servers
### What CICD
-	Is a method used to automate changes in code 
-	Small and frequent changes can be made securely by encrypting the pipeline end to end
-	CI , CD, CDE full names
-mSmall and frequent changes can be made securely 
-	Delivery changes are manually pushed to production, deployment is automatic
-	From local host all the way to users
-	Saves money by changing bugs quickly, 
-	Makes money by constantly meeting user demand

### What is IaC
-	A configuration management tool, we can config everything regardless of where the machine is, on prem, hybrid, public or multi-cloud
-	All from a source code we can manage networks, virtual machines and load balancers
-	Infrastructure as Code enables DevOps teams to test applications in production-like environments early in the development cycle. 
-	Stable environments can be managed and deployed quickly

### Tell me about a time where you faced a challenge – What was it how did you resolve it = what was the outcome
-	Previous employer, Payroll not completed
-	I learnt how to do it and completed it
